# BUSINESS ANALYTICS APPLICATION: 
To predict if a customer will churn, fraud, take loan, have some disease or not – logistic regression is used. The insurance companies (health insurance) fix their 
policies using this method. They predict the probable lifespan and expenses of a person and set premiums accordingly. Risk Premiums can be set using this tool. 
Banks also detect who will fraud and who will take loans using this technique.

## DATA: 
The data was collected and made available by “National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. 
Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian 
heritage (subgroup of Native Americans), and are females of ages 21 and above.

### DESCRIPTION: 
Logistic Regression is a widely used supervised Machine Learning classification Technique. It is the complement of Linear Regression. We predict the 
dependent variable. But, if the dependent variable is categorical, the Linear Regression technique does not work. Logistic regression predicts the outcome 
variable when it is categorical. Generally, the dependent variable has 2 categories- 0 or 1/ Yes or No. The goal is to find out the independent variables that 
can correctly predicts the binary outcome variable. Here, we use a function of Y called the logit.
We take ln(odds) to make independent variable part linear. Odds can take any non-negative value and logit can take any value from -infinity to +infinity.

#### RESULTS & DISCUSSION: 
For the Jupiter Notebook, we install all relevant packages and then import the dataset. Then we split the dataset into training and validation data. 
The 40% of data are training data and we allow the software to do it randomly. We take outcome as dependent variable and others as independent variable. 
Then we generate our full model. The intercept term and the coefficients for Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, 
Diabetes Pedigree Function and Age are printed. For example, if BMI increases by one unit then the probability of getting diabetes increases by 0.11 unit. 
Other variables can be explained by this way. We have also printed the AIC score.
Then, we have computed the probabilities.
For evaluation of performance, Confusion Matrix and Gains Chart are useful. For training data, the accuracy is 78%. For validation data, it has fallen 
very slightly. Hence, we can say that there is no overfitting problem. The model has correctly classified no diabetes cases in most of the cases. But,
we are interested in people with diabetes. In this case, the model has rightly classified 59 cases and wrongly classified 50 cases. This is the main 
problem with these algorithms.
For the Gains & Lift Chart, we sort the data as per the probability belonging to category 1. For the first 10% of the observations, logistic regression 
can predict 2.6% more accurately the diabetes case than the general model. This is the benefit of Logistic regression over other models. For the next 10%, 
it is 2.1 %. Overall, the model’s predictive accuracy is very high.

##### IMPLICATION & RECOMMENDATION: 
It is a very widely used technique. The main problem with this model is, there may be such a situation that, in validation data, the number of wrongly 
predicted cases is high. The algorithms need to be improved.
If the dependent variable has 3 or more categories, then this ML technique can not be used.
